Does your project run without error?:

Overall functionality of program works great, with one small bug


If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

Mostly all of my program functions correctly and meets the requirements. The only part that
I did not get to handle for is if a user types in an unrecognized category name when adding a purchase.
When the user does this nothing is updated to the screen, I'm not sure if we were expected to handle for this corner case or not.
However, I did handle for when the user leaves the category box empty and submits a purchase. In this case
the purchase is automatically added to uncategorized purchase category.
